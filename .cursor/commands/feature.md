# feature

I want to analyse a feature, not implement it. Clarify and remove ambiguities from my prompt. Keep asking questions in order to get a good understanding of the feature, but only ask one question at a time, and for each question give me a list of the most probable answers. When you know what you need to know about the feature, explain it to me. Your explanation should include:
  - the user story in the "As a ... I want to ... So that" format
  - A specification of what the feature is
  - A specification of what the feature is not
  - the acceptance criteria required to consider the feature done
  - a work breakdown into manageable tasks

VERY IMPORTANT: DO NOT IMPLEMENT THE FEATURE!
